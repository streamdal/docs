# [THIS REPO HAS MOVED](https://github.com/streamdal/mono)

**This is the documentation repo for the [Streamdal](https://streamdal.com) project.**

https://docs.streamdal.com

Streamdal is a combination of open-source services and SDKs that enable 
real-time:

- Data observability _(think_ `tail -f`_, but for your appâ€™s runtime data)_
- Data quality monitoring
- (Beta) Ultra-low overhead pipelines using [Wasm](https://webassembly.org/)
- (Beta) Data transformation + obfuscation + masking + stripping


To get a better understanding of what we're trying to do, our ethos, 
principles, and really, our state of mind - check out our 
[manifesto](https://streamdal.com/manifesto).

## Overview

The Streamdal documentation is broken up into two categories: `Developer Docs` 
and `Resources`.

### Developer Docs

All of the necessary information for getting started and using Streamdal can 
be found under `Developer Docs`. 

Below are some sections picked from the _Developer Docs_ that should be the most 
helpful for getting started with Streamdal:

#### Streamdal Core

- [What is Streamdal?](https://docs.streamdal.com/en/what-is-streamdal/)
- [How Streamdal Works](https://docs.streamdal.com/en/getting-started/how-streamdal-works/)
- [Quickstart](https://docs.streamdal.com/en/getting-started/quickstart/)
- [Core Components Overview](https://docs.streamdal.com/en/core-components/overview/)

#### Guides
- [Instrumentation](https://docs.streamdal.com/en/guides/instrumentation/)
- [Deployment](https://docs.streamdal.com/en/guides/deployment/)
- [Tail](https://docs.streamdal.com/en/guides/tail/)

### Resources

The `Resources` section contains other important (but mostly supplemental) 
information.

Below are some sections picked from _Resources_ that should be pretty handy 
when wanting support, clarity, or mesmerizing software factoids ðŸ§™ :

- [Getting Support](https://docs.streamdal.com/en/resources-support/get-support/)
- [FAQ](https://docs.streamdal.com/en/resources-support/faq/)
- [Open Source](https://docs.streamdal.com/en/resources-support/open-source/)
- [Changelog](https://docs.streamdal.com/en/resources-support/changelog/)

### Adding to Docs

We are committed to having informative, useful, easy-to-read, and beautiful 
documentation. We are using [Astro](https://docs.astro.build) for our docs.


To contribute to this repo:

1. **Clone the repo and make your relevant changes in a new branch.**

    You'll probably want to run the Astro dev server to make sure your changes don't look whackadoo or aren't causing build issues. Here is a quick command cheat sheet for getting that up and running:

| Command                | Action                                           |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`    | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |

2. **Submit a PR.**
    
That's it!

We may modify your additions/subtractions over time for clarity and readability. Feel free to make design requests for anything you submit (or feel is needed), and we are happy to make it happen!
