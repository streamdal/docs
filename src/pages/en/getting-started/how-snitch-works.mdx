At the heart of Streamdal is a sequence of steps that, when combined, deliver a powerful and seamless data management solution. Here's a simple workflow to understand how Streamdal's components interact:

## <span class="number-badge">1</span> Deploy Server and Console UI

Start by deploying the Streamdal server on your network. This is the foundation, translating your crafted rules into **WebAssembly (WASM)**. Alongside, set up the Console UI to be ready to showcase your data in action.

- [Streamdal Server Repository](https://github.com/streamdal/server-repo-link)

##  <span class="number-badge">2</span> Load the SDK

With the server in place, integrate the Streamdal SDK into your application. This SDK will communicate with the server, fetching the latest WASM-compiled rules, ensuring real-time data management.

##  <span class="number-badge">3</span> Access the Console UI

Now, dive into the Console UI. Here, you'll witness:

- **Data-Graph**: A visual representation of how data flows within your setup.
- **Metrics**: Essential statistics to gauge performance, consumption rates, and more.
- **Tail Data**: Real-time views of data as it traverses through your systems.
