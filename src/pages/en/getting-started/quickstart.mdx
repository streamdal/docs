Welcome to `snitch`, your comprehensive tool designed for efficiency, scalability, and simplicity. Before we jump into the deployment, let's briefly introduce the core components that will be installed:

1. **NATS**: A high-performance, lightweight, and secure messaging system. It acts as the backbone for our real-time communication in the `snitch` ecosystem.
2. **snitch-server**: The heart of `snitch`, responsible for processing, storing, and distributing data. It's optimized for fast performance and high availability.
3. **Envoy**: A modern, high performance edge and service proxy. In the context of `snitch`, Envoy handles incoming requests, ensuring efficient load balancing, and providing advanced networking features.
4. **snitch-console**: The user interface of `snitch`. It offers a clear view of your data, easy-to-use features, and seamless integration with other `snitch` components.

Now, let's explore how you can deploy `snitch` using our quick start methods: Helm, CloudFormation, or Docker Compose.
