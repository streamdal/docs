## Introducing Streamdal's Tail

For Streamdal's Tail think: `tail -f`, but for your data! It will grant you 
immediate observability into the real-time data flowing through the SDK. 

Benefits of using Streamdal Tail:

- Facilitates the formulation of new <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a>.
- Assists in validating expected outputs.
- Enables monitoring of any actively connected <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#consumer" class="pkeyword">consumer</a> or <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#producer" class="pkeyword">producer</a>.
- Provides clarity on message flows.
- Empowers you to refine configurations with greater confidence.

### How Does it Work?

Here's a step-by-step walkthrough of the user experience:

1. **Starting the Tail**:
    - Locate the “three dots” on the console and click on them to reveal a context menu.
    - You'll notice the “Tail” link in the context menu; go ahead and click it.
    - An L modal will pop up, presenting a non-editable large text box. Initially, it will display “Tail initializing...”

2. **Observing the Data**:
    - Once the tail starts, you will witness new data streaming into the console.
    - The display prioritizes recent data, maintaining a buffer of 1,000 messages or more for your convenience.
    - Each message is presented in a format that highlights its timestamp and content. For clarity and depth, the content might be segmented into multiple fields, often resembling structured data like JSON.
    - Each entry you observe is timestamped, allowing you to track the flow of data chronologically.

3. **Ending the Session**:
    - You can end the tailing session whenever you wish. Once the session is closed, the real-time data monitoring will cease.

### Under the Hood: High-Level Request Flow Diagram

While it's not crucial to grasp the underlying mechanics, here’s a glimpse into what transpires when a request is dispatched:

- On initiating a tail session, the Streamdal console's front-end sends a distinctive request to the backend.
- This directive prompts the backend to commence data streaming towards the front-end.
- The server continually channels data to the front-end, providing a live feed until the session is either closed by you or terminated due to other conditions.

By combining an intuitive interface with robust backend mechanisms, Streamdal Tail ensures you have a seamless experience, helping you keep a pulse on your data as it flows.
