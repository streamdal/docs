## Helm Deployment for Snitch Server

Deploying Snitch Server on Kubernetes using Helm has never been easier. Follow the steps below to get your Snitch Server up and running.

### **Pre-requisites**

- Helm (version 3 or above)
- An active Kubernetes cluster (version 1.16 or above)

### **1. Add the Snitch Helm Repository**

Start by adding the Snitch Helm repository:

```bash
helm repo add snitch https://streamdal.github.io/snitch/helm-charts/snitch-server
```

### **2. Update the Repositories**
After adding, ensure you update the Helm repositories:

```bash
helm repo update
```
### **3. Install Snitch Server**
With the repo added and updated, you can now install the Snitch Server:

```bash
helm install snitch snitch/snitch-server
```

### **4. Access the Snitch Console**

Once installed, you might want to access the Snitch console. Forward the console port to do so:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/snitch-snitch-server-console 3000:3000 
```

Then open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:3000.

### **5. Customizing Your Deployment with values.yaml**

Snitch Helm chart comes with a set of default configurations. However, you might want to tailor the installation to your needs. This is where values.yaml comes into play.

For instance, you might want to change the default authentication token or configure NATS storage.

Here's a brief overview of what you can configure:

* Image Settings: Like the repository, pull policy, and tag.
* Service Ports: Define ports for the Server, gRPC, and Envoy.
* Ingress Settings: Customize ingress for the main server and the console.
* Environment Variables: Set specific environment variables such as authentication tokens.
* NATS Configuration: Configure JetStream and Memory/File storage settings for NATS.


To customize, create a values.yaml file, define your settings, and then deploy using:

```bash
helm install [RELEASE_NAME] snitch/snitch-server -f values.yaml
```

For a detailed list of all configuration options, refer to the default values.yaml file provided in the Helm chart.

## Final Thoughts
Deploying Snitch Server with Helm allows for a streamlined Kubernetes deployment, and with the flexibility of the values.yaml file, you can adjust the installation to perfectly fit your environment and requirements.
