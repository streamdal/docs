Welcome to the Python Client Guide for Streamdal! If you're leveraging the 
power of Python and aim to enhance your data operations, you're on the right t
rack. Integrating Streamdal into your Python applications is both efficient and 
straightforward with our Python SDK.

## Instrumentation

Start with the [instrumentation guide](../../guides/instrumentation) if you 
haven't already. It will walk you through the process of setting up Streamdal 
and its components. 

## Getting Started

1. Install the SDK package:

```bash
python -m pip install streamdal
```

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed on your system.

### Example

Here's a basic example to help you get started with Streamdal Python SDK:

```bash
import pprint
from streamdal import (OPERATION_TYPE_CONSUMER, ProcessRequest, StreamdalClient, StreamdalConfig)

client = StreamdalClient(
    cfg=StreamdalConfig(
        service_name="order-ingest",
        streamdal_url="streamdal-server.svc.cluster.local:8082",
        streamdal_token="1234",
    )
)

res = client.process(
    ProcessRequest(
        operation_type=OPERATION_TYPE_CONSUMER,
        operation_name="new-order-topic",
        component_name="kafka",
        data=b'{"object": {"field": true}}',
    )
)

pprint.pprint(res)
```

This example demonstrates how to initialize a new instance of the Streamdal 
SDK, and how to process data through a method call. 

You simply need to create a configuration object and a process request object, 
and then call the process method on a new Streamdal instance. The result will 
be printed to the console.
